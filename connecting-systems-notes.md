network devices:

- Network devices are electronic devices used in communication of data and interaction in a network. 

- Many devices are network devices, such as:
    - hubs
    - switches
    - routers
    - modems
    - access points
    - proxies
    - firewalls
    - load balancers
    - and more

Hubs:

- Networking hubs are hardware devices which connect multiple ethernet devices together, allowing communication across devices.
- They contain many ports to allow many connections
- Hubs are less common than what they used to be due to their poor security and 'intelligence'
- Hubs have no control or knowledge on where data is being transferred. So data is freely shared through all connected devices.
- Hubs have no ip address

Switch:

- Network switches are similar to network hubs, but more advanced.
- Unlike hubs, the communication of data can be controlled and filtered between connected devices, offering better security.
- This has caused hubs to be mostly replaced by switches.

Router:

- Routers are more sophisticated than hubs and switches
- They can analyse data being transferred and send it to another network
- They can change how the data is packaged
- Routers often connect many switches to create an even larger network connection whilst switches are used to create a single network
- Routers can transmit wireless signals to allow devices to connect to the internet
- Acts as a firewall against outside threats
- Can hide the ip addresses of all devices on the network

Modems:

- Modems are network devices between the router and internet service provider
- They allow cloud connection of the router and devices connected via the router

Access Points:

- Allows devices that are too far from the router to connec to the network
- Increases router wireless coverage

Proxies:

- Between clients making a request and the server providing the request
- Increases security of client data as can act as a firewall or web filter
- Proxies use a different ip on behalf of the user to conceal the user's real ip

    Forward-proxy:
    - allows or denies the user request
    - checks if the user's request is cached, if it is then sends the data straight back to the user without requesting from the web server

    Reverse-proxy:
    - between the internet and the origin server
    - restricts and monitors user's access to web servers containing sensitive information

Firewalls:

- Controls incoming and outgoing network
- Can set rules to determine which ips can pass through the firewall
- Can be software or hardware
